                        <p>Computer Science is a highly relevant field in today's society, where every business either already has or is heading towards having an online presence. With this growing online ecosystem comes the necessity for companies to scale their digital presence and constantly optimize their processes to get an edge on competitors. One method companies have lately been resorting to is automation. Automation refers to the use of technology to perform tasks previously done by humans. This has the potential to significantly improve productivity and efficiency, freeing up people to focus on more creative and higher value-adding tasks. Automation also has the potential to reduce the risk of errors and improve the quality of goods and services.</p>
<p>Automation is possible using Artificial Intelligence, which happens to be the area I am the most keen about.  Artificial intelligence is the ability of a computer system to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence to make decisions. Moreover, Machine learning is a subset of AI in which a computer learns the ways to accomplish a task by itself without direct instruction from a human. What is most impressive about machine learning is that the bounds of what it can learn are undefined and are currently only limited by humanity's abilities and resources. This field of computer science has great potential to work wonders in fields such as computer vision (Autonomous Driving), human-computer interaction (ChatGPT), healthcare (Cancer detection), image and speech recognition (Virtual assistants like Siri), and fraud detection (online banking). Since I have always been a car guy at heart, I personally understand the value of autonomous driving in making driving safer and more convenient, which is thus one topic I always closely follow.</p>
<p>Hence, I am most interested in using Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning to automate redundant tasks, thus pushing the limits of what humans can achieve and enabling the world to be more efficient and sustainable.</p>
